My name is Michael Drogalis. I'm a Clojure developer and distributed systems designer from Seattle. I'm also the author of [Oynx](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx), a masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, distributed computation system.

I'm currently a developer with the [LonoCloud](http://www.lonocloud.com/) team at ViaSat, and prior to being an independent consultant.
