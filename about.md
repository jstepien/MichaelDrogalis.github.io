Hi! My name is Mike! I'm a Clojure developer/enthusiast/fan. Some of my projects include: 
- [Oynx](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx): A masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, distributed computation system. See the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG47Gui3hYE) I did on it at StrangeLoop!
- [Dire](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/dire): Erlang-style supervisor error handling for Clojure

I'm currently a developer at [LonoCloud](http://www.lonocloud.com/), and before that I was an independent Clojure contractor.
